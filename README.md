## Installation
1. Open your preferred terminal (e.g., Ubuntu WSL, Ubuntu bash, or any terminal that supports Git).
2. Clone the repository by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabakadev/personal_portfolio.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   * On **macOS** or **Linux**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     cd personal_portfolio
     ```
   * On **Windows**:
     - If using **Git Bash** or **WSL**, run the same command:
       ```bash
       cd personal_portfolio
       ```
     - If using **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, either:
       - Open the terminal in the folder where the repository was cloned, then run:
         ```bash
         cd personal_portfolio
         ```
       - Or provide the full path to the project folder, for example:
         ```bash
         cd C:\path\to\personal_portfolio
         ```

### Explanation:
- **macOS/Linux**: The `cd` command works universally without extra steps, as long as the terminal is open in the correct location.
- **Windows**:
  - In **Git Bash** or **WSL**, the `cd` command behaves the same as on Linux/macOS.
  - In **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, users may need to navigate to the folder manually or provide the full path if they aren't already in the correct directory.
